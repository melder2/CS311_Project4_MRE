The first issue I had was trying to figure out how to use the framework I chose to get to the end result of the 
design of the pages for the home and composer pages. It was a lot of getting rid of things I thought wouldn't
change the design aspect of the framework and then refreshing it and making sure it didn't change the design.
I would say it was just time consuming, so there weren't really any fixes that I used. Another issue I had was
trying to figure out the flexbox and trying to get it oriented correctly for the design of the pages. I watched 
the video again and looked at the page in the module explaining all of the characteristics of flexbox. Once I
figured out what settings I wanted the container that contained the image, bio, and works list, I rearranged the
image, bio, and works list in the order to where it would match the design of the pages given for the assignment.
